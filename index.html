    <header><h3 class="transparent">Intro</h3></header>
        <p id="Intro">This is a story of all the hobbies/interest I have held my whole life. My family has a trait where we get overly obsessive with things. Some have gotten that way with drugs, some have gotten that way with drinking, and some have gotten that way about solving issues that they face until it’s done(my mom) and I happened to get it pertaining to my entertaining hobbies. So this is a list of about 70% of the things I have gained an interest in, these interest, vs the other 30%, have stood the test of time and have been beneficial to my life. </p>
    <header><h3>Trumpet</h3></header>
        <p id="Trumpet">I have played trumpet since I was in the 3rd grade. I came from a musical family where everyone in the immediate family has at least played an instrument and can sing persuasively. I was the only one that couldn't sing and that couldn't play an instrument...yet. I came home one day while I was in the third grade with a bunch of papers from my teacher. I had no idea what they meant. When I gave them to my parents, they looked them over and asked what instrument I wanted to play. I didn't really understand then, being so young and unaware of what was going on. I picked a random one from a picture of instruments and my dad brought it up for me. That is when I started my voyage of playing the trumpet that lasted all the way from 3rd grade up until my senior year of high school. I didn't have the passion to play the instrument like my family thought I did, so I left it in high school. They thought I did because I was able to excel in playing it so well without practice. I still am able to play the trumpet, not quite as good as I was in high school</p>
    <header><h3>Chess</h3></header>
        <p id="Chess" class="trans">My chess ventures have been on and   off for quite some time. I first learned how to play when I was about 6 years old. I learned to play through a game on my computer, I learned the rules but I never really got into it much deeper than that because it was very easy to beat. That was until I was in the 7th grade and a friend of mine was in the school chess club. I knew how to play, I thought I could take him. I was horribly mistaken. He showed me some things that I could have done to play him better, and I had never thought of it. This was one of those moments when you’re so new that any little information given to you can help you jump a whole level and get better. I decided to take on this challenge and see just how good I was able to get. Within 2 months I was able to beat him and the chess club teacher. By that time I had found a new hobby of mine that I spent most of my time doing. My routine would be come home, get on the computer to this online chess community I was a part of and just play, watch videos, and learn how to get better. I got very good at this to the point where the year, my mom found me some chess tournaments to attend. We attended three of them and I was in the top five for all three tournaments. I didn’t too much enjoy the tournament scene so I returned to the computer and continued my online chess routine and got extremely god at playing, until I slowly lost interest as it went into Producing. 	As of now I am nowhere near as good as I was at my peak, but I am good enough to beat majority of the people that come up to me and try to play a game with me. </p>
    <header><h3>Producing</h3></header>
        <p id="Producing" class="trans">Like I said earlier my entire family had played instruments and could sing. I eventually learned how to play my musical instrument, but I still could never get the hang of singing. My family honestly told me they didn’t have any hope for me musically because I couldn’t keep a pitch when I sang or keep on rhythm. Once I got into high school, to their disbelief, I was magically able to find rhythm when I joined the marching band. I still was never able to sing music, but I was able to do one thing none of them, except for my dad, could do, and that was produce music. I heard about this program called fruity loops from a friend in school my freshman year. So during the summer when I literally had nothing to do, I decided to download it and check it out. I very soon started to emerge myself into composing hip hop melody’s and up-beat drum patterns. This was by far one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling things I have done thus far. I made beats from freshman until my junior year, then quit due to a computer crashing. Then I got a new laptop after I graduated and began my freshman year of college. New begginings… A new chapter. I started producing again but soon stopped about a year and a half later because my computer crashed and those files weren’t able to be recovered at all. As I type this I have installed the newest version of FL Studio, so hopefully things will go better from now on.</p>
    <header><h3>Dancing</h3></header>
        <p id="Dancing"><video width="300px" src="videos/Kiid_Traviie_Last_Video.mp4" align="right"></video>
            When I was a junior, my computer that I made beats with crashed. That along with a new dance craze called jerking, came into the public. That was enough for me to switch my interest into jerking, which soon lead into dancing. While I was on my jerking grind, I learned how to edit videos due to a lack of others having a computer to edit and post up videos. I jerked all the way into the end of senior year, when it started dying down. I made new friends and created a ton of good memories in the process. I lost interest due to many factors. My group that I danced with started getting harder and harder to get together to make the videos, Less and less people in general stopped participating, it started to become pointless, and then other things came into play, I was graduating without any type of plans on what to do with my life and that was just distracting from it. So I stopped jerking, and started doing regular hip hop dancing, along with praise dancing at my church. I don’t do any of the three anymore currently.</p>
    <header><h3>Video Games</h3></header></header>
        <p id="VideoGames">All growing up I was never able to experience online video games. I would go to a friend’s house every once in a while and play madden or call of duty and intensely enjoy it, but I knew I couldn’t really ask my parents for something like that. It wasn’t until I turned about 20 that they finally bought me an xbox that was able to go online. The first game I asked for/got was call of duty. There started the enjoyment of playing call of duty. I played it all day every day, except when I was in school. Huge distraction. I was even able to get good enough to make money from it playing online tournaments and against other people online. I slowed down on playing video games because there was a very nice girl that I met that I kind of pushed away because I was more into playing the games than her. I am currently unable to find her at all now, so now I don’t get attached to playing video games anymore because it reminds me of her and losing touch with the world around me. As of now I still play but very rarely. I am waiting on the new need for speed game to come out then I might get back into it, but until then, my xbox is collecting dust.</p>
    <header><h3>Coding</h3></header>
        <p id="Coding">I first heard of launch code a few years ago. My ex girl friend, we weren’t together, just friends at the time, shared it with me because she thought that with my technology savvy self, I would be interested in it. The website and her description didn’t have many details on what exactly it was about so I didn’t sign up for it. But in late 2016 I decided that the current job that I had was not where I wanted to be, and I didn’t want to make less than I made there. So I decided to get into computers. My first thought was to become a computer/phone tech because I always hung out with my friend at his job, which was sprint. The customers there would bring their phones in because they had a problem with it, and I was able to either fix it for them, or let them know what the issue was and that they wouldn’t be able to get it fixed, or at least not in the store, and the tech person would come out and say the same thing I said. I decided to look into a careers and schooling to become a computer technician, which lead to information systems, and hardware, then lead to software, which then lead to coding. I started learning on a website called freecodecamp in the beginning of 2017. A combination of me never self-teaching myself so not knowing how to pace myself and having a lack of resources to talk with face to face, along with working overnight and having trouble creating a work/sleep/study schedule, made me lose interest in learning that way. Then my sister reminded me of launch code because she said it reminded her of what I was trying to do. I went to look at the site and to my surprise it was exactly what I was doing, so I decided to sign up, and here I am today.</p>
